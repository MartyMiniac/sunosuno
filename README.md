# SunoSuno
## What is it?
I had an aim in the mind of having a webserver that can enable a client play music on one system and another client control your music(acting as a remote control) playing on the client. The problem I am trying to address is Many of us are having a smart tv at home that has it's own browser, further more we have some really cool sound system attach to it but we don't have much option other than either going with the bluetooth and deal with some audio compression or going the normal person way and trying to control the music using the included remote the too is not very handy and sometimes turn out to be a nightmare when we need to type something to search using an onscreen keyboard and arrow keys.<br><br>
## What do SunoSuno has to offer?
SunoSuno can be deployed as a webserver on your local machine sharing the same network as the smart tv of can be deployed in the cloud to access the services while connected to the internet. You can use your laptop or phone or any internet connected device with a browser to control music playing on a client (that in this problem statement is the smart tv).<br>
You can _play_,  _pause_,  _skip_,  _add more songs to current playlist_ , _serach for songs_ and even _seek control _ all from your remote device. All the things are real time and will feel as if it is being control from a remote just a lot easily.<br><br>
